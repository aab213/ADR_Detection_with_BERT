# Ensemble

This notebook is used to create an average prediction for each model type (across 5 runs), as well as create a max ensemble across three different model types. To use, create a subfolder with the prediction probabilities from each model.

To upload results to the [competition platform](https://competitions.codalab.org/competitions/20798#participate-submit_results), the output must be in the format specified in this notebook, saved in a file named `answer.txt`, and zipped up (the zip file can be named anything).
